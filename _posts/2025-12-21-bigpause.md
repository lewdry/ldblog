### Big Pause  
*A pause, not a practice.*

I've been building [**Big Pause**](https://bigpause.app), a deliberately minimal web tool for stopping briefly in the middle of everyday life.

Last year, juggling work and life, trying to be present for my family while always on, left me feeling constantly overwhelmed. I tried a few mindfulness apps but found myself stressed by the very things meant to help: notifications pinging at optimal times, guilt over broken streaks and yet another subscription to manage.

What actually helped *(alongside therapy, exercise, socialising - strongly recommend these too)* were simple breathing resets and grounding techniques. The problem? In those high-pressure moments, I couldn't remember the steps when I needed them most. Uhh, how long do I hold that breath for?

So over evenings and weekends these past few months, I built something different. Big Pause shows a single short prompt when you tap a button. There are no sessions, no programmes and no streaks. Just a moment to reset, then move on.

This is a tool I built for people like me: time-poor, overstimulated and in need of something that doesn't ask for more than we've got to give.

### Why Big Pause exists

Most wellbeing tools assume you will:
- set aside time  
- commit to a routine  
- listen, follow along, or complete something  
- return tomorrow and do it again  

That works well for some people, some of the time.

Big Pause is for the moments when none of that is realistic. When you're between meetings, before replying to a tense message, after the kids finally go to bed, or when you catch yourself scrolling mindlessly because your brain needs a break but doesn't know how to take one.

It is designed for:
- between meetings  
- before replying to a message  
- after a spike of stress  
- when you notice yourself rushing  
- when you want to stop briefly, without starting anything  

Big Pause takes seconds, not minutes.

### What makes it different

#### Built for interruption

Big Pause is designed to be opened and closed quickly.

Read a prompt.  
Pause briefly.  
Continue with your day.

If you close it immediately, that's fine too. Just use it when you need it.

---

#### Text-first, quiet by default

Most prompts are silent text-skimmable and usable anywhere without headphones.

As someone who often needs to reset in open-plan offices or on crowded trains, I needed something that works silently. Text prompts are:
- quiet  
- skimmable  
- usable anywhere  
- easy to stop at any time  

Nothing waits for you, and nothing urges you on. You decide when the pause is over.

For those moments when you want something more immersive, there's a hidden feature: tap the pause icon to toggle rain sounds and animation.

#### No commitment, no identity

You are not starting a practice.  
You are not building a habit.  
You are not failing if you do not come back.

Using Big Pause once is enough.

I wanted to create something that doesn't make you feel guilty for not using it 'properly'. There's enough pressure already.

---

#### Save what works for you

If a particular prompt resonates, you can star it to save for later or share the link with someone who might need it. No account required, just a simple way to hold onto what helps.

---

#### Small on purpose

Each prompt is short, calm and directive. There is no jargon, no motivation language and no optimisation for engagement.

### Features

- 80 curated prompts covering breathing, grounding, mindfulness, visualisation and gentle movement  
- Single-focus interface with one prompt at a time   
- Optional pink noise rain sound with calming animation (tap the pause icon)

### Built for anyone who needs it

I see the mental health pressures facing my community and friends every day. Big Pause started as something I needed, but I'm making it freely available because I know I'm not alone.

No ads. No tracking. No login.  
Just open <https://bigpause.app> on any device and reset.

If even one person finds a moment of calm they wouldn't have had otherwise, it was worth the late nights building it.
