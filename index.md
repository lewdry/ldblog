Hi, I’m Lewis, an undercover librarian living on Dharawal land in New South Wales.

I have over a decade of experience in delivering human-centred information and technology solutions in interesting organisations.

I hold a masters degree in information management. My thesis *‘Do you even document, bro?’* explored the use of data in Australian tech start-ups.

Before getting serious, I tried to be funny. In 2011 I co-wrote, co-produced and performed the comedy show *‘The Quotidian Revue’* at the Edinburgh Fringe. Broadway Baby called it **“Assured, witty and erudite”**. The Independent on Sunday called me a **“showstopper“**. All these years later, I’m still going on about it.

I spend my spare time carrying children (usually mine), cutting wood and making webapps, like:

* [ArtFlip](https://artflip.pages.dev), a flipbook of random art from the public domain
* [Playpip](https://playpip.games), a handful of *sort-of-games* I have built for (*& with*) my kids
