In 1931 the librarian S.R. Ranganathan published *‘The Five Laws of Library Science’*, a set of core tenets which contributed to the foundation of modern librarianship. These five laws were remarkably prescient, as relevant to libraries today as they were last century. This article proposes an adaptation of the five laws to define the fundamental principles of information management.

As a testament to their ongoing value, Ranganathan’s five laws are still widely taught, or at least discussed, in postgraduate librarianship and information science courses around the world. The laws describe a philosophy of how library services should be managed with respect to the library clients (readers) and information objects (books). The Five Laws of Library Science are:

1. Books are for use
2. Every reader his or her book
3. Every book its reader
4. Save the time of the reader
5. The library is a growing organism

This article won’t delve any further into library science, but if you’d like to read more about the development and specific meanings of these laws, the Wikipedia entry is a great place to start. Over the last few years, several variations of the five laws have been proposed which acknowledge the data-rich age in which we now live. Interestingly, none of these adaptations specifically address information management.

Information management as a discipline owes its development to the robust traditions of library science. So, can S.R. Ranganathan’s Five Laws of Library Science be applied to information management in a meaningful way? Yes, absolutely: the relationships between people and the information objects they require are analogous across both disciplines.

The following laws are applicable to all information professionals who manage data, documents, media or information in any format. These laws can be followed to enhance the design of information systems and processes or to guide an overall approach to governance.

#### The Five Laws of Information Management

**1. Information is for use**

The reason for information to be created, collected or curated must be for use: to meet some immediate or future need. If this law isn’t followed, information may be blindly produced and hoarded for no justifiable reason. Useful information can be over-managed – controlled so strictly that it cannot be easily accessed and leveraged. The fact that information should exist to be used – to be understood, ingested, applied, transformed or remixed – is a key principle for any information professional. This law is related to the concept that ‘information wants to be free’, that there is some destiny for an information object.

**2. Every user needs information**

Even the most unlikely user will require access to some piece of information. All users should be empowered to find and use the information they need. Information should be as accessible and free as possible; retrieval options designed with people at the heart of the process; information presented in context for appropriate personas. Whatever your environment, there are no non-service-users.

**3. All information has a user**

The second law’s other half. If some information object, or information type has value, then it should controlled in such a way that it is retrievable – even if it seems relatively obscure. Someone out there needs it. This law is about facilitating and encouraging discovery, even ‘serendipitous discovery’, accidentally stumbling upon information which matters to you. It’s difficult to know what you don’t know – often information seekers aren’t able to articulate a need using the ‘correct’ terminology or search strategy. Good, human-centred system design can compensate for this.

**4. Save the time of the user**

There is no greater purpose for an information professional than to make information more readily accessible and more easily used. Information objects should be well described with accurate metadata. Information should be searchable and retrievable. Not just retrievable, but retrievable with context, so the user can understand exactly what they have found and whether their information need has been met.

**5. Information always grows**

It’s a truism, but one worth bearing in mind: information repositories of all formats grow and evolve over time. It’s important to prepare for growth and change in the design of any product or service. The way this can be achieved is heavily dependent on format: spare shelf space in a hardcopy filing room; scalable capacity in a cloud storage service or embedded extensibility in a new system. There is no such thing as a futureproof system, but information professionals should acknowledge the inevitability of change and not allow themselves to be tied to a rigid framework.

**The Five Laws of Information Management**

1. Information is for use
2. Every user needs information
3. All information has a user
4. Save the time of the user
5. Information always grows

Although these five laws represent only a small update to the original *‘Five Laws of Library Science’*, it is proposed that there is value in defining a distinct set of guiding laws specifically for information management.
