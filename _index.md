Welcome to my blog! I write about cool stuff.

## Recent thoughts

Here are some things I've been thinking about lately...

I’m Lewis, a Scottish-Australian undercover librarian, living on Dharawal land in New South Wales. I have over a decade of experience in delivering human-centred information and technology solutions in interesting organisations.

I hold a masters degree in information management. My thesis ‘Do you even document, bro?’ explored the use of data in Australian tech start-ups.

Before getting serious, I tried to be funny. I co-wrote, co-produced and performed the comedy show ‘The Quotidian Revue’ at the 2011 Edinburgh Fringe. Broadway Baby called it “Assured, witty and erudite”. The Independent on Sunday called me a “showstopper“.

All these years later, I’m still going on about it.
