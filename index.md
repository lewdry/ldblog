Hi, I’m Lewis, an undercover librarian and technologist living on Dharawal land in New South Wales.

I have over a decade of experience in delivering human-centred data and technology solutions in government agencies and regulated industries.

I hold a masters degree in information management. My thesis *‘Do you even document, bro?’* explored how Australian tech start-ups use data.

Before getting serious, I tried to be funny. In 2011 I co-wrote, co-produced and performed the comedy show *‘The Quotidian Revue’* at the Edinburgh Fringe. Broadway Baby called it **“Assured, witty and erudite”**. The Independent on Sunday called me a **“showstopper“**. All these years later, I’m still going on about it.

I spend my spare time carrying children (usually mine), or making websites like:

* [Artflip](https://artflip.me), a collection of 6,000+ public domain artworks displayed serendipitously
* [What We Know About You](https://whatweknow.pages.dev), a lightweight, ad-free tool showing how much data your browser reveals
* [Playpip](https://playpip.games), a handful of games I have built for *and with* my children
