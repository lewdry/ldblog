Hi, I’m Lewis, an undercover librarian living on Dharawal land in New South Wales.

I have over a decade of experience in delivering human-centred data and technology solutions in government agencies and regulated industries.

I hold a master's degree in information management. My thesis *‘Do you even document, bro?’* explored how Australian tech start-ups use information and data.

Before getting serious, I tried to be funny. In 2011 I co-wrote, co-produced and performed the comedy show *‘The Quotidian Revue’* at the Edinburgh Fringe. Broadway Baby called it **“Assured, witty and erudite”**. The Independent on Sunday called me a **“showstopper“**. All these years later, I’m still going on about it.

I spend my spare time carrying children (usually mine), woodworking or making things on the web, like:

* [Artflip](https://artflip.me), public domain art from the world's best collections
* [Big Pause](https://bigpause.app), simple prompts for mindful moments
* [Playpip](https://playpip.games), games built for (and with) my kids

I also maintain the open source, good news feed **Ramah**, which collates positive stories from around the world.
