Hi, I’m Lewis, an undercover librarian and developer living on Dharawal land in New South Wales.

I have over a decade of experience as a public sector data and technology practitioner, delivering human-centred solutions in government agencies and regulated industries.

I hold a master's degree in information management. My thesis *‘Do you even document, bro?’* explored how Australian tech start-ups use information and data.

Before getting serious, I tried to be funny. In 2011 I co-wrote, co-produced and performed the comedy show *‘The Quotidian Revue’* at the Edinburgh Fringe. Broadway Baby called it **“Assured, witty and erudite”**. The Independent on Sunday called me a **“showstopper“**. All these years later, I’m still going on about it.

When I’m not carrying children (usually mine), I’m either woodworking or building interactive, light and joyful experiences for the web. You can [explore a selection of my projects here]({{ '/projects/' | relative_url }}).

Feel free to get in touch via the links below.

Thanks for stopping by!
