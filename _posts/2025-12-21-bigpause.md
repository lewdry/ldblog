I've been building [**Big Pause**](https://bigpause.app), a minimal web app for resetting in the middle of everyday life.

Last year, I started struggling with juggling work and life. I couldn't switch off at home, I couldn't focus at work. Sometimes I'd lie on the floor in my home office and groan instead of... literally anything else. All of the wonderful possible activities that exist and are available to me in my privileged life felt a little to difficult or daunting. I'd lie on the floor with my heart rate through the roof, worrying about things that might happen to me.

After a couple of months of this, I went along to the doctors and was diagnosed with anxiety. About 17% of Australians [experience an anxiety disorder each year](https://www.aihw.gov.au/mental-health/overview/prevalence-and-impact-of-mental-illness). As many as 43% of Australians will experience a mental illness in their lives. Despite how common this is, it felt isolating and embarrassing. Like I was completely alone with no way to feel better. 

When I first noticed I wasn’t feeling great, I tried a few mindfulness apps. They helped in theory, but in practice I found myself stressed by the experience. Notifications pinged at awkward times. Broken streaks came with a quiet sense of guilt. And there was always another subscription to manage.

I'm a lot better now. Even better than I felt before *the wobble*. What helped me in part *(alongside therapy, exercise, socialising, medication and actually talking to people about how I was feeling)* were simple breathing resets and grounding techniques. There are a million out there, but I often couldn't remember the steps when I needed them most. Uhh, how long do I hold that breath for? How many sounds am I meant to notice?

So over some recent evenings and weekends, I built Big Pause.

Tap a button, and it shows a single short prompt. There are no sessions, no programmes and no streaks.

### Why Big Pause exists
Most wellbeing tools assume you will:
- set aside time  
- commit to a routine  
- listen, follow along, or complete something  
- return tomorrow and do it again  

That works well for some people, some of the time.

Big Pause is for the moments when none of that is realistic. When you’re between meetings, before replying to a tense message, after the kids finally go to bed, or when you catch yourself scrolling because your brain needs a break but doesn’t quite know how to take one.

It is designed for:
- between meetings  
- before replying to a message  
- after a spike of stress  
- when you notice yourself rushing  
- when you want to stop briefly, without starting anything  

Big Pause takes seconds, not minutes.

### What makes it different

#### Built for interruption
Big Pause is designed to be opened and closed quickly.

Read a prompt.
Pause briefly.
Continue with your day.

If you close it immediately, that's fine too. Just use it when you need it.

#### Text-first, quiet by default
Most prompts are silent text-skimmable and usable anywhere without headphones.

I often need to reset at work or on crowded trains, I needed something that works silently. Text prompts are:
- skimmable
- usable anywhere
- easy to stop at any time

For moments when you want something more immersive, there’s an optional extra: tap the pause icon to toggle rain sounds and a subtle animation.

#### Small on purpose
Each prompt is short, calm and directive.

### Features
- 80 curated prompts covering breathing, grounding, mindfulness, visualisation and gentle movement
- Single-focus interface with one prompt at a time
- Keyboard friendly navigation using Space or Enter
- Accessible design with WCAG AA contrast and screen reader support
- Private by default with no analytics, cookies or accounts 
- Progressive Web App (PWA) that works fully offline
- Mobile-first and responsive across screen sizes
- Fast loading with no external dependencies

### Built for anyone who needs it
I see the mental health pressures facing my community and friends every day. Big Pause started as something for me, but I'm making it freely available because I know I'm not alone.

No ads. No tracking. No login. If you feel like you need a micro-break, you can open <https://bigpause.app> on any device and reset.
