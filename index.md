Hi, I’m Lewis, a Scottish-Australian stealth librarian living on Dharawal land in New South Wales.

I have over a decade of experience in delivering human-centred information and technology solutions in interesting organisations.

I hold a masters degree in information management. My thesis *‘Do you even document, bro?’* explored the use of data in Australian tech start-ups.

Before getting serious, I tried to be funny. In 2011 I co-wrote, co-produced and performed the comedy show *‘The Quotidian Revue’* at the Edinburgh Fringe. Broadway Baby called it **“Assured, witty and erudite”**. The Independent on Sunday called me a **“showstopper“**.

All these years later, I’m still going on about it.

Feel free to reach out to me using the links below. 

Thanks for stopping by!
