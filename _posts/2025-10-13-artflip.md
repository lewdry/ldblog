### What's an Artflip?
In my spare time, I’ve been building a site that surprises you with a different piece of art. It’s called **Artflip**, and you can try it here: [Artflip.me](https://artflip.me). 

You might be here because you've just been there. In that case, stay here, don't go back there. *Phew*.

Visit Artflip and you'll see a random artwork. Click 'New' or tap on the right 1/3 of the image and get a new artwork. And another. Sometimes it’s a painting, sometimes a sculpture, sometimes a decorated jar from 4000 BCE. I’ve found it’s a good source of inspiration and less toxic than other scrolling options.

### Why Artflip?
I had a vague 'is this possible' idea recently, which turned into a small obsession. *Is there an 'easy' (**read, zero effort**) way to discover public-domain art?* I've been trying to use public domain images in blogs and projects on-and-off for the last few years, starting in around 2017. It's a *huge pain in the bum*. My enthusiasm tends to die quickly. It requires you to:

* Have an idea of **where** you want to look: a museum with an open access policy, an aggregator like 'Unsplash'
* Have an idea of **what** you're looking for: a search term, a medium
* Have the **patience** to scroll, scroll, scroll through pages of results

You need a search strategy before you get started. That kind of discovery takes headspace and effort. There didn't appear to me, to be a truly random or *serendipitous* way to be presented with **something good** and **something free to use**. 

The internet is full of vast collections of public-domain art which often go unleveraged. The **Metropolitan Museum of Art**, the **Rijksmuseum**, and the **Art Institute of Chicago** have digitized over a million of artworks between them. They've also waived copyright on high-resolution images, which is a generous, but fairly uncommon, move in the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) world.

### How It Works
Artflip pulls from a growing collection of over 5,000 highlighted public-domain artworks, sourced from the Met, Rijksmuseum, and Art Institute of Chicago. Where possible, I've tried to pull artworks which have some marker of quality: art flagged as a 'highlight' or which is 'on display' in the museum. If either of those is true, then the artwork has passed some kind of curatorial benchmark.

- Every flip is randomly chosen from the collection.
- Every image is free to reuse: print it on a t-shirt, put it in a presentation, or get it as a tattoo.
- The site is intentionally simple*: you focus on the art, not the interface. 

*Of course I would say this. I'd need a total architectural change to add a search function, so I'm happy to pretend any simplicity is by design.

#### Behind the Scenes: The Artflip Stack
Artflip looks pretty straightforward, and it is, but there are some interesting things behind the scenes. I'm recording here, partly for my own record and partly for any nerds who are interested. Skip ahead if this isn't your thing.

#### 1. Frontend
The site is written in **Svelte**, a compiler-based JavaScript framework that I've used for other projects. I chose it because React felt too heavy for what I wanted. Svelte is lightweight, fast and clean. Even so, it's still overkill for what I'm doing on Artflip, but it comes with some quality-of-life improvements over vanilla JS, which has caused me to lose hair in the past.

#### 2. Automation & Updates
Artflip checks for new highlighted artworks added to the Met, Rijksmuseum and Art Institute of Chicago weekly and adds them to the Artflip collection automatically. It does this through three Python scripts: named Metfetch, Rijksfetch and Chicfetch. These run in GitHub Actions every Friday night. Last week they added 38 new artworks.

Artflip also posts to Instagram twice a day (under the handle @artflip.me). Getting the Instagram/Meta API to work was 10x harder than all the museum API scripting combined. But now it's running, and it ticks along nicely. I’ve made myself redundant, which is exciting.

#### 3. Backend
The site is hosted on the unfathomably generous free tiers of GitHub and Cloudflare. The code and automations live in GitHub. The domain management and hosting in Cloudflare. The only money I have spent on Artflip has been for the domain name.

#### 4. Data Sources & APIs
- The museums’ APIs are amazing, but occasionally confusing and obviously all with their own quirks.
- The first version of Artflip (called **RandyMet**) just hotlinked random images from the Met. It would run an API call through a proxy, ask for a huge set of artworks, then select one at random. It took ages. Sometimes you'd face 60 seconds of a spinning progress wheel, sometimes longer.
- This method worked, badly, until it didn't. As a result of my crude API calls, my IP address got throttled, and then blocked by the Met (sorry Met!)... which demanded a re-write.
- After some conversations with friends, I landed on a better pattern. Pull the artworks once, politely, then host and serve them myself. ALmost like some kind of 'server'... hmm, now there's an idea.
- So I pulled the images and metadata into my own GitHub repository, and all the lag and misbehaviour disappeared.

#### 5. AI Assistance
Not represented in the architecture is the AI assistance I leaned on for the trickier coding. I have experience using Python for data analysis and migration, and writing simple webpages in JavaScript, but much of the scripting in Artflip was beyond my muggle capabilities. In particular, I relied on Claude Code and Sonnet 4-4.5 to: 

* solve API quirks by making best-guesses at undocumented parameters
* format Elasticsearch queries for the Art Institute of Chicago API
* guide me through the Instagram/Meta developer labyrinth

Claude also helped me automate the build process which creates the static site elements. I should mention, Anthropic's Claude is *my strong favourite* of the maintream AI LLM assistants.

I tried ChatGPT-5 but found it lazy and unreliable. It would regularly 'forget' parts of my code, or a generic solution to a problem I wasn't having. When questioned, it would respond that it hadn't actually read the code I'd shared, but assumed or invented instead. I'm not sure if that's a technical limitation, or an economic belt-tightening by OpenAI.

I tried Google's Gemini but found it simiarly unhelpful.

I relied on GitHub Copilot to **write my commit messages**, I completely outsoruced this repetitive task. GitHub Copilot auto-selects a method based on the task, I think in my case choosing GPT-5 mini and it didn't seem to hallucinate any commits. I actually think this is the most exciting AI use case: automating drudgery, summarising a range of changes across a codebase into a human-readable short message.

### Lessons Learned
- The generosity of museums in digitizing and waiving copyright is extraordinary. It's a huge investment of real money, and real time. All for a vague and diffuse public good.
- Artflip only scrapes the surface of these resources: around **0.5% of available highlights from these museums**, but I think it feels special.
- Automation can make a product feel alive without constant attention. Artflip's latest Friday-night-update took place while I was splashing around on the beach with my kids.
- Even a passing *silly idea* can become a passion project and something worthwhile.

### Where To From Here
I’m not entirely sure what’s next for Artflip. Some ideas I’ve considered:

- Adding another museum's highlights to the collection (I'm looking at you, Smithsonian) 
- Tidying up the scripts to make something re-usable and open source
- Adding some kind of search function...

For now, *Artflip feels finished*. I’m proud of it, and I hope it sparks a small amount of joy and serendipity among anyone who visits it.

If you have suggestions, spot any 'dud' artworks (I have culled a lot of images of leather-bound book covers, but some may remain) or want to submit a pull request via GitHub, I’d be grateful to hear from you.
