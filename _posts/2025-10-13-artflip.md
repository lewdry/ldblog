# Artflip: Serendipitous Discovery

### What's an Artflip?
In my spare time, I’ve been building a site that surprises you with a different piece of art. It’s called **Artflip**, and you can try it here: [https://artflip.me](https://artflip.me). You might be here because you've just been there. In that case, stay here, don't go back there. Phew.

Load up Artflip and you'll get a new, random artwork. Click 'New' or tap on the right 1/3 of the image and get a new artwork. And another. Sometimes it’s a painting, sometimes a sculpture, sometimes a decorated jar from 4000 BCE. I’ve found it’s a good source of inspiration, slightly less toxic than some other scrolling options available.

### Why I Built Artflip
I had a vague 'is this possible' idea recently, which turned into a small obsession. *Is there an 'easy' (**read, zero effort**) way to discover public-domain art?* I've been trying to use public domain images in blogs and projects on-and-off for the last few years, starting in around 2017. It's just a massive pain in the bum. My enthusiasm dies pretty quickly. You need to:

* Have an idea of **where** you want to look: a museum with an open access policy, an aggregator like 'Unsplash'
* Have an idea of **what** you're looking for: a search term, a medium
* Have the **patience** to scroll, scroll, scroll through pages of results

Basically, you need a search strategy before you get started, which takes headspace and effort. There didn't appear to me, to be a truly random or 'serendipitous' way to be presented with **something good** and **something free to use**. 

The internet is full of vast collections of public-domain art which often go unnoticed. Museums like the **Metropolitan Museum of Art**, the **Rijksmuseum**, and the **Art Institute of Chicago** have digitized millions of artworks between them. They've also waived copyright on high-resolution images, which is a generous, but fairly uncommon, move in the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) world.

### How It Works: The Concept
Artflip pulls from a growing collection of over 5,000 highlighted public-domain artworks, from the Met, Rijksmuseum, and Art Institute of Chicago. Where possible, I've tried to pull artworks which have some marker of quality: those flagged 'highlights' or which are 'on display' in the museum. If either of those is true, then the artwork has passed some kind of curatorial benchmark.

- Every flip is random.
- Every image is free to reuse: print it on a t-shirt, include it in a presentation, or even get it as a tattoo.
- The site is intentionally simple*: you focus on the art, not the interface. 

*Of course I would say this. I'd need a complete architectural change to add a search function, so let's pretend any simplicity is by design.

#### Behind the Scenes: The Artflip Stack
Artflip looks pretty simple, and it is, but there are some smarts behind the scenes. I'm recording here, partly for my own record and partly for any nerds who want to know. Skip ahead if this isn't your thing.

#### 1. Frontend & UX
The site is written in **Svelte**, a compiler-based JavaScript framework that I've used for other projects. I chose it because React felt too complicated for what I wanted and beyond my muggle comprehension. Svelte is lightweight, fast, and clean. Even so, it's still overkill for what I'm doing on Artflip, but it comes with some quality-of-life improvements over vanilla JS, which has caused me to lose some hair in the past.

#### 2. Automation & Updates
Artflip checks for new highlighted artworks added to the Met, Rijksmuseum and Art Institute of Chicago weekly and adds them to the Artflip collection automatically. It does this through three Python scripts: which I've named Metfetch, Rijksfetch and Chicfetch. These run in GitHub Actions every Friday night. Last week they added 38 new artworks, all portraits for some reason.

Artflip also posts to Instagram twice a day (under the handle @artflip.me). Getting the Instagram/Meta API to work was 10x harder than all the museum API scripting combined. But now it's running, and it ticks along nicely. I’ve made myself redundant, which is exciting.

#### 3. Infrastructure & Hosting
The site is hosted on the unbelievably generous free tiers of GitHub and Cloudflare. The code and automations live in GitHub. The domain management and hosting through Cloudflare. I think that more or less makes the site DDOS-proof.

#### 4. Data Sources & API Fun
Some technical joys and pains:

- The museums’ APIs are amazing, but occasionally confusing and obviously all different with their own quirks.
- The first version of Artflip (called RandyMet) just hotlinked random images from the Met. It would run an API call through a proxy, ask for a huge set of artworks, then select one at random. It took ages. Sometimes 60 seconds of a spinning progress wheel, sometimes longer.
- This method worked, badly, until it didn't. As a result of my crude API calls, my IP address got throttled, and then temporarily blocked... which demanded a re-write
- After some conversations with friends, I landed on a better pattern. Pull the artworks once, politely, then host and serve them myself. Like some kind of 'server'... hmm, now there's an idea.
- So I pulled the images into my own store, and all the lag and misbehaviour disappeared.
- Once, I had to cold-email the Rijksmuseum for some advice on how to filter their API. They replied in English within **four hours**, offering a solution and promising to follow up when new features are available. I don't get that kind of customer service from my wife, let alone a Museum 10K miles away.

### Lessons Learned
- The generosity of museums in digitizing and waiving copyright is extraordinary. It's a huge investment of real money, and real time, for a vague and diffuse public good.
- Artflip only scrapes the surface of these resources: maybe **0.5% of available highlights from these museums** — but it feels quite special.
- Automation can make a project feel alive without constant attention. Artflip's latest Friday-night-update took place while I was lying on the beach with my family. How cool is that?
- Even a “silly idea” can become a minor obsession, and the most rewarding projects often start small.
- And one art-related learning: Did you know that well-off American families in the 1800s would have their dead children painted into family portraits...?

### Where To From Here
On that cheerful note, I'll wrap up. I’m not entirely sure what’s next for Artflip. Some ideas I’ve considered:

- Adding another museum's highlights to the collection (I'm looking at you, Smithsonian) 
- Tidying up the scripts and making something re-usable and open source
- Adding some kind of search function...

For now, Artflip feels finished. I’m proud, and I hope it sparks a small amount of joy and serendipity among anyone who visits.

I’d love it if you spent a minute or two flipping through Artflip. If you have suggestions, spot any 'duds' (I have culled most leather-bound book covers, but some remain) or want to submit a pull request via GitHub, I’d be grateful to hear from you.
