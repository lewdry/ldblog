I've been building [**Big Pause**](https://bigpause.app), a minimal web app for resetting in the middle of everyday life.

I'm a fairly anxious person. Last year, I had a bit of a wobble where I felt constantly overwhelmed. I tried a few mindfulness apps but found myself stressed out by some of the features: notifications pinging at awkward times times, guilt over broken streaks and juggling another subscription.

I'm a lot better now. What helped *(alongside therapy, exercise, socialising)* were simple breathing resets and grounding techniques. There are a million out there, but I often couldn't remember the steps when I needed them most. Uhh, how long do I hold that breath for?

So over some recent evenings and weekends, I built Big Pause. It shows a single short prompt when you tap a button. There are no sessions, no programmes and no streaks.

This is a tool I built for people like me: time-poor, overstimulated and in need of something simple and (hopefully) helpful.

### Why Big Pause exists
Most wellbeing tools assume you will:
- set aside time  
- commit to a routine  
- listen, follow along, or complete something  
- return tomorrow and do it again  

That works well for some people, some of the time.

Big Pause is for the moments when none of that is realistic. When you're between meetings, before replying to a tense message, after the kids finally go to bed, or when you catch yourself scrolling mindlessly because your brain needs a break but doesn't know how to take one.

It is designed for:
- between meetings  
- before replying to a message  
- after a spike of stress  
- when you notice yourself rushing  
- when you want to stop briefly, without starting anything  

Big Pause takes seconds, not minutes.

### What makes it different

#### Built for interruption
Big Pause is designed to be opened and closed quickly.

Read a prompt.
Pause briefly.
Continue with your day.

If you close it immediately, that's fine too. Just use it when you need it.

#### Text-first, quiet by default
Most prompts are silent text-skimmable and usable anywhere without headphones.

I often need to reset at work or on crowded trains, I needed something that works silently. Text prompts are:
- quiet
- skimmable
- usable anywhere
- easy to stop at any time

For those moments when you want something more immersive, there's a hidden easter egg: tap the pause icon to toggle rain sounds and animation.

#### Small on purpose
Each prompt is short, calm and directive.

### Features
- 80 curated prompts covering breathing, grounding, mindfulness, visualisation and gentle movement
- Single-focus interface with one prompt at a time
- Optional pink noise rain sound with calming animation (tap the pause icon)
- Keyboard friendly navigation using Space or Enter
- Accessible design with WCAG AA contrast and screen reader support
- Private by default with no analytics, cookies or accounts  
- Progressive Web App (PWA) that can be installed like an app and works fully offline
- Mobile-first and responsive across screen sizes
- Fast loading with no external dependencies

### Built for anyone who needs it
I see the mental health pressures facing my community and friends every day. Big Pause started as something for me, but I'm making it freely available because I know I'm not alone.

No ads. No tracking. No login. YOu can open <https://bigpause.app> on any device and reset.
