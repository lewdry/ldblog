Sometimes, lying on my home office floor at 2pm on a Tuesday wasn't rock bottom, it was just another Tuesday.

I'd stare at the ceiling, heart racing, unable to work but also unable to stop thinking about work. My mind wouldn't switch off at home. My body wouldn't settle at the office. All the wonderful things I could be doing: reading, seeing friends, going for a walk—felt impossibly hard. So I'd just lie there, frozen by anxiety.

After a few months of this, I finally went to my GP and heard something that surprised me: I wasn't alone. About [17% of Australians experience an anxiety disorder each year](https://www.aihw.gov.au/mental-health/overview/prevalence-and-impact-of-mental-illness). Nearly half of us will face a mental health challenge at some point in our lives. 

Yet somehow, it still felt isolating. Like I was the only one who couldn't just pull it together.

### When self-care feels like another chore

When I first realised something was wrong, I did what many of us do. I downloaded some mindfulness apps. They worked in theory. But in practice? They became another source of stress.

Notifications pinged during meetings. Broken daily streaks brought quiet guilt. Every app wanted money, attention, or both. I needed help, but I didn't have the energy to manage another thing.

I'm doing much better now, genuinely better than before *the wobble*. It took a combination of things: therapy, medication, exercise, opening up to people I trust. But one of the simplest tools that helped was also the hardest to remember when I needed it most.

Breathing exercises. Grounding techniques. The kind you can do anywhere in 30 seconds.

Except I could never remember the steps. Wait, how long do I hold this breath? How many sounds am I supposed to notice?

So over some recent evenings and weekends, I built [**Big Pause**](https://bigpause.app).

You tap a button. You get one short prompt. That's it.

No sessions to complete. No streaks to maintain. No programmes to follow. Just a quick reset when you need it, nothing when you don't.

### Who it's for

Most wellbeing tools assume you will:
- set aside time  
- commit to a routine  
- listen, follow along, or complete something  
- return tomorrow and do it again  

That works beautifully for some people, some of the time.

Big Pause is for all the other moments:
- between back-to-back meetings when your shoulders are up by your ears
- before you reply to that message that made your stomach drop
- after the kids finally go to bed and you realise you've been clenching your jaw all day
- when you catch yourself mindlessly scrolling because your brain needs a break but doesn't know how to take one
- in the supermarket queue when the overwhelm starts creeping in

It takes seconds, not minutes. You can use it on a crowded train, in a toilet cubicle, at your desk. Anywhere you need a moment but can't exactly roll out a yoga mat.

### What makes it different

#### Built for real life
Big Pause is designed to be opened and closed quickly.

Read a prompt.  
Take a breath.  
Get on with your day.

If you close it after five seconds, that's fine. There's no judgement, no data tracking your "progress," no notifications reminding you that you're failing at self-care.

#### Quiet by default
Most prompts are just text—no audio required.

I needed something I could use at work, on public transport, or anywhere people might be around. You can skim the text and follow along silently.

Text prompts are:
- skimmable
- usable anywhere without headphones
- easy to stop at any time

For times when you want something more immersive, there's an optional extra: tap the pause icon for gentle rain sounds and a calming animation. 

#### Small on purpose
Each prompt is short and clear. No meditation philosophy. No complicated instructions. Just simple direction: 'Place your hand on your chest. Feel it rise and fall three times.'

### What's inside
- 80 carefully written prompts covering breathing, grounding, mindfulness, visualisation and gentle movement
- Single-focus interface with one prompt at a time
- Works on your phone, tablet, or computer
- Works fully offline—use it on planes or in places with patchy reception
- Private by default with no analytics, cookies or accounts 
- Keyboard friendly navigation using Space or Enter
- Fast loading with no external dependencies

### Why I'm sharing this
I see the mental health pressures facing people every day: friends, family, colleagues, neighbours. Big Pause started as something for me during a difficult patch, but I'm making it freely available because I know I'm not alone in needing it.

No ads. No tracking. No login required. No catch.

If you need a 30-second reset today, you can open <https://bigpause.app> on any device and... pause.
